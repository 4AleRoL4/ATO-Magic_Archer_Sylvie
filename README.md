I'll be modifying this data frequently to make balance. So the picture maybe isn't the true number. You can check them out at the Town of Knowledge in game.

## Support

I will keep watching for cards strength, try to make sure these cards display their strength that should be there. Create a real magic archer instead of only using sharp to deal damage.

Unfortunately, I can't redo all traits' effect now. So it's not all the effects I am expecting. I'll realise them in future.

Hope you enjoy it and if have any idea or bug, just open a github issue or make a post in the **modding #support-and-requests** channel of the [official Across the Obelisk Discord](https://discord.gg/across-the-obelisk-679706811108163701).
